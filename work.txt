2 tbsp of coconut yogurt + extra for serving

1-2 tbsp of maple syrup (optional)

Method:

Add the raspberries, vanilla extract, coconut yogurt and coconut milk to a blender and blend until smooth. In a large bowl add the chia seeds, pour in the raspberry milk and mix everything together using a whisk to prevent any lumps.

Benefits:

Loaded with cell-protecting antioxidants, chia seeds deliver a massive amount of nutrients with very few calories and are a good source of minerals like calcium. They help prevent constipation by providing insoluble fibre, which along with the protein content helps one to lose weight.

Raspberries are low in calories but boast many nutrients apart from being a very good source of fiber and high in antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress. Their consumption helps reduce the risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses due to their antioxidant content. They may positively impact blood sugar, improve arthritis, aid in weight loss and may also combat ageing.

Though raspberries are best to eat after purchasing, they can also be frozen and enjoyed at any time of year with same healthy option.

Maple syrup extract may dramatically increase the potency of antibiotics according to researchers at McGill University in Canada. Another study claims that consuming pure maple syrup extract may help protect against Alzheimerâ€™s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons and maintain neuronal integrity during aging.
